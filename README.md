MIT GSL Brazil 2018! 

This repository will be the home base for the technical side of this year's *Global Startup Labs*! Each session will have a folder with the relevant coding exerises and a README that summarizes that session's in-class activity and homework, to be done before the next day's session.

If you have any issues with any of the content, feel free to write up an issue!
